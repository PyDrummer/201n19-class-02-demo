7-25: UPDATE to this file for Lab:03
I will now be adding my top 10 at the bottome of the HTML page as an ordered list.
I'm adding a 6th question that takes a numeric input and indicates if the answer is too high or low. It will give the user exactly 4 opportunities. If all are incorrect it will tell the user the right answer.
I'm also adding a 7th question which will be multiple choice with all answers shown at the prompt. It will have the answers stored in an array. 6 chances to get this one right. The guesses will stop once the user is correct or they run out of choices. 

I'll be implementing a loop for question 6 and 7.

At the end i will tell them how many answers they got correct.
